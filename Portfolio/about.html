      </header>
      <main>
        <p>I have discovered the profession of software development by searching for well-payed careers that I could learn to help sustain myself in the future. Though my true passion is in storytelling, I hope that I can use the learning experiences I have gained so far to better myself.</p>
        <p>Software development is not entirely what I expected at first. Coding by itself, is very technical and difficult to grasp with the many functions and calculations I had to learn. But I do find it interesting. I still have three more semesters of learning left and I already feel like I've learned so much.</p>
